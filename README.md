# twitter-chinese-text

I use Twitter as a tool to improve my reading skills in Chinese. I download periodically tweets from various News sources.
This repo has a few simple scripts that extract the downloaded tweets-archive and transform the tweets stored in a .js file into csv and markdown files.

I rely on the Pleco app, Wiktionary and Google's Translation site to look up the many words that are incomprehensible to me. 

These are the two markdown files that contain my lists of curated vocabulary words and names that I am studying.

1. [words_curated_study_list.md](cards_hanzi_words/words_curated_study_list.md)
   
   A subset of curated words with their English definitions. The words here are also categorized.

2. [words_tweets_stats.md](cards_hanzi_words/words_tweets_stats.md).
   
   The entire set of curated words.
